-> Project Goal Description: Building a DW for a Hybrid SOC that can be managed by a small team or single employee.
In order to acheive this I found I could use Gliffy, Excel, Power BI and Azure Sentinel to develop a SEIM Dashboard
and Data Pipeline to offer SOC as a service on a Hybrid Cloud. Data Connectors offer a means to do so.

-> Architecture: [Lambda] 0) Data Files -> 1) Power Bi
				     	-> 2) Sentinel

-> Tables:

busiess dimension
	Customers -
	Employees -
	Partners - 

security logs dimension
	Blocklist - 
	Whitelist - 
	Login Attempts - 
	Open Incidents (Alerts) - 

	"Normal" Training Data (User & Entity Behavior Analytics [UEBA] AKA Logs)
	--> can be gathered in Azure Sentinel by deploying an Agent to a device on its network
	Live Agent Logs Analytics

Incident Response dimension:	
	Playbooks -
	Closed Incidents - 
	MTRE ATT&CK - 

	APTs
	Malware DB

-> Business Rules [can be applied as Analytics Rules (Sentinel Analytics)]:

0. Customer Submits Request for Service, Billing information is confirmed; Automated ticket is generated

1. Auto-Assign Customer-Related Incidents to the analyst on staff. If more than one, assign severity to seniority.
(Mild/Low Risk to Lvl 1 Analyst, Medium to Lvl 2, High to Lvl 3 (or highest ranking analyst on staff)).

2. On assignment, send alert to the appropriate analyst (IF login attempt, join login_attempt table, else join playbooks & ResolvedIncidents

3. Load known threat intel via custom logs; configure firewall; plug in connecter (Ex: Azure Firewall, Palo Alto)

4. Automated Incident Response can be acheived via creation & deployment of Playbooks

5. If need be, conduct a manual investigation; if possible create deployment playbook to automate solution

6. For protected servers blocked from internet use: Use OMS Gateway to access

7. Once incident is resolved, mark as such; auto-suspend billing and send email alert to customer.
